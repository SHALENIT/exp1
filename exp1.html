<h1 style="font-size:50px;text-align:center;">Spintronics-Emerging technology</h1>
<p style="color:yellow;">Spintronics or spin electronics is the study of the role that is played by the spin of an electron in the solid-state physics and other devices that exploit spin properties. Spintronics is also known as spin Flextronics is the study of the intrinsic spin of the electrons and its associated magnetic moment, in addition to fundamental electronic charge in solid-state devices.</p>

<h3>Example:</h3>
<p title="Definiton" style="color:yellow;"><i>For example, spin transport and spin relaxation in semiconductors and metals are important solid-state physics issues that are included in the fundamental research along with new technology being implemented in the electronic storage technology.</i></p>

<h4 style="color:pink">Some of the applications are</h4>
<p style="color:yellow;"><b>
Spintronic devices are used in the field of mass-storage devices.
It is used to compress massive amounts of data into a small area, as an instance, approximately 
one trillion bits per square inch (1.5 Gbit/mm²) or roughly 1 TB data can be stored on a single-sided 3.5? diameter disc.
Spintronics is also used in the medical field to detect cancer.
Spintronic technology in general holds promises for digital electronics.
It has been tested in mass-storage components namely hard drives.</b></p>

<h3 style="color:pink;font-family:courier"><u>Future works</u></h3>
<p style="color:yellow"> This is the 1<sup>st</sup> work i.e Creation of spin polarization through optical or magnetic injection
Spin-polarized Transport through semiconductor/superconductor interfaces
Spin relaxation in metals and semiconductors
Spin-based devices such as PN junctions and amplifiers
Spin-based quantum computation and electron entanglement in different semiconductor devices
